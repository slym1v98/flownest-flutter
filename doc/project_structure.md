### Project structure

The project structure is based on the clean architecture pattern. The project is divided into three
main layers: data, domain, and presentation.
In addition to these layers, there is a core module that contains the shared code between the layers
like the constants, extensions, utils, etc.

Four layers are wrapped in a package called `lib/src`.

Also, the project contains the localization files in the `lib/l10n` directory.

The project structure is as follows:
